  <h2>A Secondhand Hound Success Story </em>
  <p><h3> <em>from Kentucky to Minnesota... </em></h3>

  <!--
    insert some inspirational quote about dog/animal companionship
  --!>

<p>As a puppy he was plucked out of a high-kill dog pound in Kentucky and found himself in a van driving North.</p>

  <p> Once he arrived in Minnesota he had to be checked over by a vet before he could begin looking for a new,  <em>forever,</em>  home.</p>

<p>Once I laid eyes on him, I knew his home was with me.
  </p>


<blockquote><h3> "Dog's are not our whole life. but they make our lives whole." </h3></blockquote>


<p>He spends his days patrolling the yard for rabbits and trying relentlessly to engage his older, smarter, much smaller and crabby canine sister in play.</p>

<p><h4>His favorite things to do: </h4>

    <ul><li> chase bunnies out of the yard</li>
    <li>play ball</li>
    <li>go for car rides and stick his head out of the window</li>
    <li> find a patch of sun to curl up and nap in</li>
</ul>

<p><h4> His top 5 favorite foods:</h4>

<ol><li> chicken </li>
<li> peanut butter</li>
<li> raspberries</li>
<li> banana</li>
<li>carrot </li>
</ol>
