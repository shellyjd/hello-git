  <h1>Humans vs. Machines: An AI Odyssey</h1>
  <p> By <em><b> Christopher Watkins </em></b>
  <p> March 10, 2016</p>
  <p><em><b>***Breaking News: AlphaGo has won the first two matches!
    *** </em></b>In this, the third in our series on the epic Go matches
    being played between AlphaGo (Google’s Artificial Intelligence
    software) and Lee Se-Dol (Current Go World Champion), we look at
    the history of Humans vs. Machines, and the innovations that have
    led us to this incredible moment in time.

  <p> For as long as humans have built things, we’ve wrestled with
      the implications of what we’ve built. In many cases, these 
      philosophical and ethical wrestlings have made for great drama—think 
      Frankenstein, or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often, the hypothetical scenarios 
      we envision come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we’ve made 
      in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make 
      clear that a “computer with a mind of its own” is going to take over the
      world not such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer.</P>

  <h2>The Triumph Of Deep Blue</h2>
  <p>Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs. 
   machine competitions,because the idea of being overcome 
   by that which we’ve created speaks to something very 
   deep within our collective consciousness. When IBM’s 
   Deep Blue faced off against Garry Kasparov1, the event 
   resulted in more than three billion impressions around 
   the world, and when IBM’s later creation Watson challenged 
    the champions on Jeopardy, millions of viewers were glued 
    to the proceedings.</p>

  <h2>DeepMind’s AlphaGo</h2>
  <p>Taking place right now, there is an event that, while not 
    likely to scale the same media heights, may in fact have far 
    greater implications when it comes to the future of “intelligent” 
    machines. On March 9, in Seoul, South Korea, a computing 
    system know as AlphoGo (built by researchers at DeepMind—a 
    Google Artificial Intelligence lab) began a five-game match 
    against Lee Se-dol, one of the very best players in the 
    world at the ancient game of Go.
